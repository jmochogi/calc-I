You do not need to simplify the expressions for $f^′(x)$.\na.  $f(x)=x^{17}+17$ \n\\vspace{3cm}\n\nb.  $f(x)=\\frac{x^2+4}{x^2-4}$ \n\\vspace{3cm}\n\nc.  $f(x)= e^x^3$ \n\\vspace{3cm}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na.  Find $C(2)$ and interpret its meaning in context.\n\n\\vspace{2cm}\n\nb.  Find $C(5)$ and interpret its meaning in context.\n\n\\vspace{2cm}\n\nc.  Use a table to find the left limit of the function at $x=3$ (i.e., $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to 3^-} C(x)$).\n\n\\vspace{4cm}\n\nd.  Use a table to find the right limit of the function at $x=3$ (i.e., $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to 3^+} C(x)$).\n\n\\vspace{4cm}\n\ne.  Based on your work in parts (c) and (d), state whether the limit $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to 3} C(x)$ exists and explain why. If the limit exists, find its value.\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Question 2\n\nThe daily receipts $f(t)$ in millions of dollars of the movie \"The Hunger Games\" after its opening on 23 March 2012 had an exponential model shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](exam-2-review_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na.  Use the graph to estimate the value of $f(15)$ and state its meaning in context. \\vspace{4cm}\nb.  Without doing any calculations, state whether you expect $f(25)$ to be greater or less than $f(35)$. Explain how you know. \\newpage\nc.  Without doing any calculations, state whether you expect the average rate of change between $t=10$ and $t=25$ to be greater or less than the average rate of change between $t=25$ and $t=40.$ Explain how you know. \\vspace{4cm}\nd.  Without doing any calculations, state whether you expect $f'(30)$ to be negative or positive. Explain how you know. \\vspace{4cm}\ne.  Without doing any calculations, state whether you expect $f''(30)$ to be positive or negative. Explain how you know. \\vspace{4cm}\nf.  Let $f(20)=16.4$ and $f(30)=10.8$. Use these values to estimate $g'(25)$. Interpret your answer in context. \\newpage\n\n## Question 3\n\nA climate model predicts that the average global temperature rise (in degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels can be approximated by the function $T(t)=0.008t^3−0.06t^2+0.5t+0.2$, where $t$ represents time in decades since 2000.\n\na.  Find $T(2)$ and interpret its meaning in context. \\vspace{3cm}\nb.  Estimate the *average rate of change* in the global temperature rise between $t=0$ and $t=1$. Include units in your answer. \\vspace{5cm}\nc.  The expression below is for finding the *instantaneous rate of change* in the global temperature rise at $t=1$ using the limit definition of the derivative. Write down the next step. No need to evaluate the limit.\n\n$$T'(1)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{T(1+h)-T(1)}{h}$$ \\vspace{4cm}\n\nd.  Use the appropriate derivative rule(s) to find the function $T'(t)$ then use it to evaluate $T'(1)$. Interpret the meaning of $T'(1)$ in context. \\vspace{4cm}\n\ne.  Calculate $T''(3)$ and interpret its meaning in context. \\newpage\n\n## Question 4\n\nUse derivative rules to find the derivative function for each of the following functions:\n\na.  $f(x)=3x^2-4x+5$ \\vspace{3cm}\nb.  $g(x)=\\frac{x^5+x^3}{x^2}$ \\vspace{3cm}\nc.  $h(x)=\\sqrt{x}+x^2$ \\vspace{3cm}\nd.  $k(x)=5^x+x^5$ \\vspace{3cm}\ne.  $q(x)= e^x + 5x^4$\n",
