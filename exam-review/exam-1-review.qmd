## Question 1

The piecewise function below represents the shipping charges, $C(x)$, for packages based on the package weight, $x$ (in pounds).

$$C(x)=\begin{cases} 4.50, &  0 < x \leq 3 \\ 0.5(x-3)+4.50,  &  3 < x \le 10 \\ 0.5(x-10)^2+7.50, &  10 < x \leq 12. \end{cases}$$

a. Find $C(2)$ and interpret its meaning in context.

b. Find $C(5)$ and interpret its meaning in context.

c. Use a table to find the left limit of the function at $x=3$ (i.e., $\lim\limits_{x \to 3^-} C(x)$).


d. Use a table to find the right limit of the function at $x=3$ (i.e., $\lim\limits_{x \to 3^+} C(x)$).

e. Based on your work in parts (c) and (d), state whether the limit $\lim\limits_{x \to 3} C(x)$ exists and explain why. If the limit exists, find its value.


## Question 2

The daily receipts $f(t)$ in millions of dollars of the movie "The Hunger Games" after its opening on 23 March 2012 had an exponential model shown below:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
t <- seq(0, 120, by = 10)
R <- 37.855 * 0.959^t
plot(t, R, type = "l", xlab = "Days after opening", ylab = "Daily receipts in millions of dollars")
```

a.  Estimate the value of $f(20)$ and state its meaning in context.

b.  Without doing any calculations, state whether you expect $f(25)$ to be greater or less than $f(30)$. Explain how you know.

c.  Without doing any calculations, state whether you expect the average rate of change between $t=15$ and $t=25$ to be greater or less than the average rate of change between $t=40$ and $t=80.$ Explain how you know.

d.  Without doing any calculations, state whether you expect $f'(30)$ to be negative or positive. Explain how you know.

e.  Without doing any calculations, state whether you expect $f''(30)$ to be positive or negative. Explain how you know.

## Question 3

A climate model predicts that the average global temperature rise (in degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels can be approximated by the function $T(t)=0.008t^3âˆ’0.06t^2+0.5t+0.2$, where $t$ represents time in decades since 2000.

a. Find $T(2)$ and interpret its meaning in context.  

b. Estimate the *average rate of change* in the global temperature rise between $t=0$ and $t=1$. Include units in your answer.

c. The expression below is for finding the *instantaneous rate of change* in the global temperature rise at $t=1$ using the limit definition of the derivative. Write down the next step. No need to evaluate the limit.

$$T'(1)=\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{T(1+h)-T(1)}{h}$$

d. Use the appropriate derivative rule(s) to find the function $T'(t)$ then use it to evaluate $T'(1)$. Interpret the meaning of $T'(1)$ in context.

e. Calculate $T''(3)$ and interpret its meaning in context.



## Question 4

Use derivative rules to find the derivative function for each of the following functions:

a. $f(x)=3x^2-4x+5$

b. $g(x)=\frac{x^5+x^3}{x^2}$

c. $h(x)=\sqrt{x}+x^2$

d. $k(x)=5^x+x^5$

e. $q(x)= e^x + 5x^4$
